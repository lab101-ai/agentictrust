Here’s a Product Requirements Document (PRD) version of your detailed OAuth security strategy for LLM-based agents. It includes key functionalities, requirements, and the additional instruction that each task (and its sub-tasks/tools) must include the parent OAuth token to verify task context and lineage.

# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**  
**Title:** Secure OAuth Framework for LLM-Based Agents  
**Owner:** [Your Name / Team]  
**Date:** March 29, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## **Objective**  
To design and implement a secure, scalable, and task-aware OAuth-based authentication and authorization system for LLM-based agents (e.g., Operators, LangChain agents). The system must ensure that each agent action is traceable, scope-constrained, and verified through parent-child OAuth context.

---

## **Problem Statement**  
LLM-based agents execute sensitive and autonomous tasks via API calls, necessitating a robust identity, authentication, and scope enforcement system. Conventional OAuth flows need augmentation to support agent-specific challenges like task attribution, human-in-the-loop validation, and third-party service federation.

---

## **Key Requirements**

### 1. **Authentication Mechanisms**
#### 1.1 Agent Identity
- Use **OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials Grant** for machine-to-machine agent auth.
- Secure storage of credentials via AWS Secrets Manager or equivalent.
- Enforce **Device Authorization Grant** for agents lacking UI.
- Support **CIBA (Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication)** for sensitive actions.

#### 1.2 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
- **Step-Up Authentication** with MFA for high-risk tasks.
- **Watch Mode** for user pre-approval on destructive actions.

---

### 2. **Authorization and Scope Control**
#### 2.1 Scoping
- Define **granular scopes** tied to task context (e.g., `read:calendar`, `write:inventory`).
- Implement **Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)** for dynamic permissioning based on task/sub-task.

#### 2.2 Token Policies
- Enforce **short-lived tokens** (default 1 hour).
- Use **refresh tokens** stored in encrypted vaults.
- Bind tokens to device via **mTLS** or **DPoP**.
- Enable token **revocation** through admin panel.

---

### 3. **Session Management**
- Store sessions via **encrypted cookies** or JWTs with auto-expiry.
- Invalidate sessions on anomalous IP/device detection.
- Apply rate limits (e.g., 100 RPM per agent) and cost caps (e.g., for paid API actions).

---

### 4. **Security and Monitoring**
- Prohibit plaintext secrets; use secure input channels for MFA.
- Enforce **automated secret rotation**.
- Use **moderation layers** for prompt injection detection.
- Maintain **domain/IP blocklists** for known malicious actors.

---

### 5. **Audit and Compliance**
- Log every agent action with:
  - Timestamp  
  - Client ID  
  - OAuth scope  
  - Resource accessed  
  - Task/sub-task ID  
  - Parent OAuth token (if applicable)

- Assign restricted roles to agents (e.g., `ai-processor`, `ai-reader`).
- Ensure **no destructive scopes** assigned by default.

---

### 6. **Federation and Third-Party Integration**
- Implement **OIDC with claims** (e.g., `ai_agent: true`).
- Use **Token Exchange** to broker federated access to Gmail, Slack, etc.
- For legacy systems, use **ephemeral credential injection**.

---

### 7. **Agent Experience (AX)**
- Provide clear **consent prompts** (“This agent will access your calendar 3x daily”).
- Allow users to **review and revoke scopes** post-authorization.
- Return **LLM-friendly error codes** (e.g., `insufficient_scope`) with next-step suggestions.

---

## **New Requirement: Task-Level OAuth Verification**
Every API call must include:
- **Current Task ID**
- **Current OAuth Token**
- **Parent Task ID (if nested)**
- **Parent OAuth Token**  
→ System will validate:
  - Hierarchical scope inheritance
  - Valid parent-child token lineage
  - Authorization limits based on task type

This allows agents to only act within their intended execution flow and improves traceability.

---

## **Success Criteria**
- >95% of agent actions correctly scoped and logged with task lineage
- No tokens used beyond their authorized scopes
- <2% of API abuse or cost overage incidents
- Seamless user experience with consent and revocation support
