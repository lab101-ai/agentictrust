# AgenticTrust Authorization for Agents

This document outlines the plan to build an advanced authorization system for AI agents (LLMs). While traditional auth systems are primarily designed for human users, this implementation will create a similar system specifically for AI agents.

## Current State of AgenticTrust

AgenticTrust is a secure OAuth 2.1 authentication and authorization system for LLM-based agents with the following features:

- **OAuth 2.1 compliance** with mandatory PKCE for all flows
- **Authorization Code Flow** with PKCE for web and mobile apps
- **Client Credentials Flow** with PKCE for machine-to-machine authentication
- **Refresh Token** support with PKCE verification
- **Dynamic Client Registration** support
- **Task-aware tokens** with parent-child lineage verification
- **Scope inheritance** from parent to child tasks
- **OIDC-A claims** for agent identity and capabilities

The system already has a robust foundation for agent authentication and authorization, but lacks specific features for human-to-agent delegation that would enhance its capabilities.

## Planned Authorization Features for Agents

The following tasks outline the implementation plan to enhance AgenticTrust's authorization capabilities for agents:

### Task 1: Human User Model and Authentication

**Description:** Create a model for human users who can delegate to agents, with comprehensive user management capabilities.

**Subtasks:**
1. Create `User` model with authentication fields
2. Implement user registration and login endpoints
3. Add user profile management
4. Implement password reset functionality
5. Add support for social login providers (optional)

**Files to Modify:**
- Create: `agentictrust/db/models/user.py`
- Create: `agentictrust/routers/users.py`
- Create: `agentictrust/schemas/users.py`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Human users can register and authenticate
- User profiles can be managed
- Authentication flows follow industry standards

### Task 2: User-Agent Authorization Model

**Description:** Implement a relationship model between users and agents to track which agents a user has authorized.

**Subtasks:**
1. Create `UserAgentAuthorization` model
2. Implement endpoints to manage user-agent authorizations
3. Add UI components for users to view and manage authorized agents

**Files to Modify:**
- Create: `agentictrust/db/models/user_agent_authorization.py`
- Modify: `agentictrust/routers/agents.py`
- Create: `agentictrust/schemas/user_agent_authorization.py`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can authorize and deauthorize agents
- Authorizations include scope restrictions
- Authorization history is tracked

### Task 3: Human-to-Agent Token Delegation

**Description:** Implement token delegation from human users to agents, allowing agents to act on behalf of users.

**Subtasks:**
1. Create delegation token request schema
2. Implement token delegation endpoint
3. Add delegation logic to OAuthEngine
4. Implement token handler for delegation
5. Add delegation verification

**Files to Modify:**
- Modify: `agentictrust/schemas/oauth.py`
- Modify: `agentictrust/routers/oauth.py`
- Modify: `agentictrust/core/oauth/engine.py`
- Modify: `agentictrust/core/oauth/token_handler.py`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agents can request tokens on behalf of human users
- Delegated tokens include proper scopes and claims
- Token lineage is maintained
- Delegation can be revoked

### Task 4: Policy-Based Authorization for Delegated Tokens

**Description:** Implement OPA policies for controlling when and how agents can act on behalf of users.

**Subtasks:**
1. Create human delegation policy
2. Implement policy checks in token issuance
3. Add policy enforcement for resource access
4. Create policy management UI

**Files to Modify:**
- Create: `demo/policies/human_delegation.rego`
- Modify: `agentictrust/core/oauth/token_handler.py`
- Modify: `agentictrust/routers/oauth.py`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Policies control delegation permissions
- Policies can be managed through UI
- Policy decisions are logged for audit

### Task 5: Enhanced Audit Logging for Delegation

**Description:** Extend the audit logging system to track delegation events and agent actions on behalf of users.

**Subtasks:**
1. Add delegation-specific audit events
2. Implement user activity tracking
3. Create delegation audit reports
4. Add delegation chain visualization

**Files to Modify:**
- Modify: `agentictrust/db/models/audit/token_audit.py`
- Modify: `agentictrust/db/models/audit/task_audit.py`
- Create: `agentictrust/db/models/audit/delegation_audit.py`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All delegation events are logged
- Audit logs show complete delegation chains
- Reports can be generated for compliance

### Task 6: Role-Based Access Control for Agents

**Description:** Implement RBAC adapted for agent-specific roles and permissions.

**Subtasks:**
1. Create role and permission models
2. Implement role assignment for agents
3. Add permission checks to resource access
4. Create role management UI

**Files to Modify:**
- Create: `agentictrust/db/models/role.py`
- Create: `agentictrust/db/models/permission.py`
- Modify: `agentictrust/routers/oauth.py`
- Create: `demo/policies/rbac.rego`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agents can be assigned roles
- Permissions are enforced based on roles
- Roles can be managed through UI

### Task 7: Documentation and SDK Updates

**Description:** Update documentation and SDK to support the new authorization features.

**Subtasks:**
1. Update API documentation
2. Create delegation examples
3. Update SDK with delegation support
4. Create integration guides

**Files to Modify:**
- Modify: `README.md`
- Create: `docs/delegation.md`
- Modify: `sdk/agentictrust/client.py`
- Create: `sdk/examples/delegation_example.py`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Documentation covers all new features
- SDK supports all new endpoints
- Examples demonstrate proper usage

## Security Considerations

When implementing these features, the following security considerations must be addressed:

1. **Privilege Escalation Risk**: Implement strict scope inheritance rules and policy-based authorization checks.
2. **Token Theft**: Use short-lived tokens, strict validation of task lineage, and comprehensive audit logging.
3. **Replay Attacks**: Implement token binding to specific contexts and tasks.
4. **Confused Deputy Problem**: Validate the purpose and context of each token request against policy rules.
5. **Audit Trail Gaps**: Ensure enhanced logging captures both agent identity and human delegator.

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Tasks 1-2 - Human User Model and User-Agent Authorization
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Tasks 3-4 - Token Delegation and Policy-Based Authorization
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Tasks 5-6 - Enhanced Audit Logging and RBAC
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8)**: Task 7 - Documentation

## Conclusion

This implementation will enhance AgenticTrust with advanced authorization capabilities for agents, providing a secure and comprehensive authentication and authorization system specifically designed for AI agents acting on behalf of human users. The implementation will leverage the existing OAuth 2.1 infrastructure while adding delegation capabilities, enhanced security features, and comprehensive audit logging.
